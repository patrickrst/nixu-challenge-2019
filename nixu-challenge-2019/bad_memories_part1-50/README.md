## Bad memories - part 1

**Categories:** forensics, 2019
**Points:** 50
**Description:**

>  The lead graphical designer at ACME has noticed some kind of strange
>  activity on her computer. Their IT support believes it is a false
>  positive and the computer will fix itself after turning it off and 
>  on again. However, the user managed to take a memory dump just before
>  the crash. Could you help us recover the documentation she was working on?
>  
>  
>  This is part 1 of 5 in a memory dump analysis challenge found in
>  mem.7z.  The parts are numbered loosely according to the 
>  difficulty level. (If something doesn't work, just try elsewhere.)
