**Description:**

>  Our whole cloud infrastructure was accidentally deleted by an erroneous
>  deployment script. We have tape backups but they are encrypted using a very
>  secure passphrase and it turns out it was stored in a git repository
>  in the cloud. We were able to construct a complete git log of the
>  repository since a developer had setup an unauthorized bot that was
>  quietly tweeting all commits to the world. The log is attached as
>  gitlog.txt.

>  Can you help us recover the key?
