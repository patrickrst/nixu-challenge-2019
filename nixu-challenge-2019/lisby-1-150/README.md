**Description:**

>  On a slow day we were digging through our graveyard of long-forgotten
>  computers. These were from an era when a computer still meant a massive
>  construction with wires all over the place. And what did we find?! A LISBY
>  DEVICE! The grumpy greybeards have spoken of such marvelous things! In the
>  distant past, programmers of the old would use such special hardware optimized
>  just for running programs made with the LISBY language.
>  
>  Alas, the hardware itself has long since been rendered inoperable by decades
>  of neglect, but we were able to salvage the contents of some of the magnetic
>  tapes, which seem to contain programs. Sadly, we have no time to figure out
>  how they work, so perhaps you will help us to rediscover the old ways.
>  
>  Our search for documentation was mostly a failure, but we managed to find a
>  one crucial part: A brief architecture guide!
>  
>  Our cursory investigation reveals that the LISBY DEVICE seems to contain a
>  large variety of different op codes, but probably not all of are needed to
>  understand or run the programs. Perhaps successfully decompiling the programs
>  is a good start!
