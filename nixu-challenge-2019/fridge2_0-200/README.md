**Description:**

>  Recently you jumped on the smart home bandwagon and ordered an
>  intelligent fridge from a promising startup company.  The letter
>  which accompanied the device says: "Congratulations for choosing our
>  intelligent cloud-connected heat removal solution for consumables!
>  Note that we are in an early phase, which means that our operations
>  staff is keeping an extremely close eye on the fleet management
>  portal, monitoring all device registrations."
>  
>  
>  In addition you also got a CD-ROM(!) with the firmware updater for
>  the fridge along with the current firmware.

>  network, could be because of the very restricive firewall...
