# Introduction

As our project we participate in the 2019 edition of the Nixu Challenge. The Nixu Challenge is a yearly Capture-The-Flag (CTF) event organized by the cyber security company Nixu Corporation. In a CTF event the participants try to complete various challenges with the objective of retrieving specific tokens. The Nixu Challenge consists of a variety of challenges related to subjects like web security, memory analysis, cryptography and reverse engineering. The difficulty level range from simple problems solvable in a couple of minutes to complex challenges.

Our goal is not to solve every single challenge but to beat as many as possible and report how we solved them, what we've learned and how it is relevant to the course. We also want to complete diverse challenges of all difficulties for the report to touch on as many subject as possible.
