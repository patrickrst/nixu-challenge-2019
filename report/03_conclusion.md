# Conclusion

Participating in the Nixu Challenge have been a varied and educational experience. It is in the nature of Capture The Flag events that the knowledge needed, and gained, will be in a wide array of areas and not as in depth as some other projects could have provided. However, compared to earlier capture the flag experiences of the group the Nixu Challenge provided more demanding and less elementary. 

As Nixu is an actual company working within the cyber security field and the challenge is a part of their recruitment the project have also given us some insight into the kind of knowledge and abilities companies are looking for in potential junior hires and trainees.
