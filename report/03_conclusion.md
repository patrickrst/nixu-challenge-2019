# Conclusion

Participating in the Nixu Challenge have been a varied and educational experience. It is in the nature of Capture The Flag events that the knowledge needed, and gained, will be in a wide array of areas and not as in depth as some other projects could have provided. However, compared to earlier capture the flag experiences of the group the Nixu Challenge provided less elementary. At the same time one should not disregard the importance of a wide knowledge base as exploits based on quite basic faults are still common. Attacks against typical internet connected devices, like IoT-devices and routers, are more often than not using attack vectors like default credentials, overflow attacks or injections [@securityevaluators_routers]. More intricate attacks are usually only executed by APTs [@wiki_apt] and are used by the common hacker only when leaked, disclosed through zero-day patches or in other ways revealed to the public.

As Nixu is an actual company working within the cyber security field and the challenge is a part of their recruitment the project have also given us some insight into the kind of knowledge and abilities companies are looking for in potential junior hires and trainees.

In relation to the course content, many of the challenges where related to the technical part of what we have seen in class. For example, the use of Wireshark was essential in multiple challenges in network security. Other concepts that we have seen in class include buffer overflow, query injection in a database system and two-factor authentication. Like we said, we have covered a wide range of categories about information security while not having went in depth in a particular one or having touched the more theoretical parts of the course content.
